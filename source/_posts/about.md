I\'m a Ph. D. student in the school of Computer Science and Technology at Shandong University, Qingdao, advised by [Prof. Dani Lischinski](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~danix/) and [Prof. Lin Lu](http://irc.cs.sdu.edu.cn/~lulin/index.html). I got my bachelor degree from Shandong University in 2017. My research interest is focused on Computer Graphics and Digital Fabrication. Recently, I\'m working on structural modeling with microstructures.
